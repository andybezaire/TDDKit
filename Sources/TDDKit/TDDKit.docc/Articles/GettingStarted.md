### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add this package as a dependency to the **test target** of your Swift package. 

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.8
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SampleProduct",
    products: [
        .library(name: "SampleProduct", targets: ["SampleProduct"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "TDDKit", url: "https://github.com/andybezaire/TDDKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "SampleProduct", dependencies: []),
        .testTarget(name: "SampleProductTests", dependencies: ["SampleProduct", "TDDKit"])
    ]
)

## Documentation

It is recommended to add the documentation to your documentation browser
for the most immersive experience. ðŸ˜Ž

The documentation can be generated from this package using: 

```bash
swift package generate-documentation --include-extended-types
```

> Note: This package includes mainly extensions,
> so the `--include-extended-types` flag is neccesary.

The documentation is also available on [GitHub](https://example.com)
