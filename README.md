# TDDKit ![test status](https://github.com/andybezaire/TDDKit/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg) ![license MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andybezaire/TDDKit)

You are now leveled up in your test driven development experience in *Swift*. ðŸš€


## Overview

TDD is a great way to write code. It improves code quality and brings *great joy*. ðŸ˜Š

But it also brings a lot of **boilerplate**. ðŸ¤¬ 

`TDDKit` is designed with TDD in mind. These opinionated helpers keep 
you writing great tests that are clear, concise and to-the-point.

ðŸ«µðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ‰
