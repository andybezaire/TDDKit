# TDDKit ![test status](https://github.com/andybezaire/TDDKit/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg) ![license MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andybezaire/TDDKit)
A grouping of helpers used to improve the testing experience.

TDD is a great way to write code. It improves code quality and brings great joy. ðŸ˜Š

But it also brings a lot of boilerplate. 

These test helpers are designed with TDD in mind. 
They can help with writing tests that are clear and reduce boilerplate code.


## Helpers

### XCTAnyError

This `Equatable` `Identifiable` `Error` can be used to help test errors thrown by dependencies.

Usage:
```swift
func test_failingGetUsername_createPoem_fails() async throws {
    let error = XCTAnyError()
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT(getUsernameResult: .failure(error))
    
    let capturedError = await XCTCaptureError(from: try await sut.createPoem())
    
    XCTAssertCastEqual(capturedError, error)
}
```

### Assert Cast Equal

Sometimes and optional value needs to be cast and compared with a real result. 
If the cast is performed inside the assert equal, it is not clear if 
the captured value was the wrong type or if it was nil. This can lead to 
using a separate assert is not nil check, adding boilerplate.

This method will first check to see if the value is not nil and then 
will perform the cast and assert equal, giving nice error messages for each case.

Usage:
```swift
func test_failingGetUsername_createPoem_fails() async throws {
    let error = XCTAnyError()
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT(getUsernameResult: .failure(error))
    
    let capturedError = await XCTCaptureError(from: try await sut.createPoem())
    
    XCTAssertCastEqual(capturedError, error)
}
```

### Assert Contains Equal

When comparing two collections for equality, sometimes it is not clear if 
the captured collection was the same but just in a different order, 
or if the collections were actually containing different elements. This can lead to 
using separate asserts to compare the `count`s and check for `contains`, adding boilerplate.

This method will check to see if the collections have the same elements 
and will give a nice error messages when elements are missing or extra.

Usage:
```swift
func test_createPoem_callsServices() async throws {
    let (sut, spy) = makeSUT()

    _ = try await sut.createPoem()
    
    XCTAssertContainsEqual(spy.messages, [.getAge, .getUsername])
}
```

### Assert Count Equal

When comparing two collections for equality, sometimes it is not clear if 
the captured collection was the wrong size or if it had differnt values. This can lead to 
using a separate assert to compare the `count`s, adding boilerplate.

This method will first check to see if the collections have the same `count` and then 
will assert equal on the elements, giving nice error messages for each case.

Usage:
```swift
func test_fetch_succeeds() async throws {
    let (values, response) = uniqueValuesSet()
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT(fetchResult: .success(response))

    let capturedValues = try await sut.fetch()
    
    XCTAssertCountEqual(capturedValues, values)
}
```

### Assert Will Deallocate Instance

Memory leaks occur when an object is not properly released from memory. 
This often happens when mistakenly creating a circular strong reference.

This method will help to catch these kinds of errors by making sure 
that your object has been deallocated by the end of the test. 
It is most useful to use it in your `makeSUT` method.

Usage:
```swift
private func makeSUT(
    userLoginResult: Result<Void, Error> = .success(()),
    file: StaticString = #file,
    line: UInt = #line
) -> (sut: LoginFlow, spy: Spy) {

    let spy = Spy(userLoginResult: userLoginResult)
    let sut = LoginFlow(service: spy)

    XCTAssertWillDeallocate(instance: sut, file: file, line: line)
    XCTAssertWillDeallocate(instance: spy, file: file, line: line)

    return (sut, spy)
}
```

### Capture Error

The `do`-`try`-`catch` dance with optional captured errors can add a lot of boilerplate to your tests. 

This helps by turning the error capture into a single line. A non-optional error is returned 
or a test failure happens if an error is not thrown.

Usage:
```swift
func test_failingGetUsername_createPoem_fails() async throws {
    let error = XCTAnyError()
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT(getUsernameResult: .failure(error))
    
    let capturedError = await XCTCaptureError(from: try await sut.createPoem())
    
    XCTAssertCastEqual(capturedError, error)
}
```

### Capture is Main Thread

Subscribing to a Publisher and managing the `AnyCancellable` in a test leads to a lot of typing, 
and can distract from the main focus of the test.

This function helps to make your code more clear. Put the actions which will cause the publishes
in the block and `XCTCaptureIsMainThread` will return the results.

Usage:
```swift
func test_refreshTitle_publishesOnMainThread() async throws {
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT()

    let capturedIsMainThread = await XCTCaptureIsMainThread(for: sut.$title) {
        await sut.refreshTitle()
    }

    XCTAssertCountEqual(capturedIsMainThread, [true])
}
```

### Capture Output

Subscribing to a Publisher and managing the `AnyCancellable` in a test leads to a lot of typing, 
and can distract from the main focus of the test.

This function helps to make your code more clear. Put the actions which will cause the publishes
in the block and `XCTCaptureOutput` will return the results.

Usage:
```swift
func test_refreshTitle_setsIsLoading() async throws {
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT()

    let capturedOutput = await XCTCaptureOutput(for: sut.$isLoading) {
        await sut.refreshTitle()
    }

    XCTAssertCountEqual(capturedOutput, [true, false])
}
```

### Capture Output Of

Subscribing to a Publisher and managing the `AnyCancellable` in a test leads to a lot of typing, 
and can distract from the main focus of the test. When sampling a var that depends on the output, 
adding an additional sample is even more boilerplate.

This function helps to make your code more clear. Provide a closure to compute the result and 
put the actions which will cause the publishes in the block and `XCTCaptureOutput` will return the results.

Usage:
```swift
func test_refreshTitle_setsLoadingText() async throws {
    let (sut, _) = makeSUT()

    let capturedOutput = await XCTCaptureOutput(of: { sut.loadingText }, for: sut.$isLoading) {
        await sut.refreshTitle()
    }

    XCTAssertCountEqual(capturedOutput, ["Loading...", "Finished"])
}
```

### Index Array Subscript

Accessing an array with an index that is out of bounds will cause a runtime crash in swift. 
If this happens in a test, the default Xcode settings will pause execution and open the debugger. 
Also the error message is not very clear.

This array subscript helps by successfully failing the test and showing a nice error message at the point of access.

Usage:
```swift
func test_doLogin_callsServices() async throws {
    let (sut, spy) = makeSUT()

    sut.doLogin()

    XCTAssertEqual(spy.messages.count, 1)
    XCTAssertEqual(spy.messages[xctIndex: 0], .userLogin)
}
```
